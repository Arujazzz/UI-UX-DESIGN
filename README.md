# UI-UX-DESIGN
The final project

## ABOUT
Food delivery apps for one restaurant called NON SOLO PASTA

### Role
I started with competitive analysis by trying competitor apps and reading app reviews
Conducted user interviews with users who order food online or eat out.
Create low-mid hybrid screens in Figma
Create low-mid and high fidelity prototypes in Figma also

### Target and Challenge
NON SOLO PASTA had a very clear target, a target that needs an extremely easy and fast to use solution.

### Research
With the project idea defined, I searched online for food delivery apps which gave me a better understanding of the existing food delivery apps out there. For each app, I identified what key features they had and read reviews to identify pain points and what features people want. 



## Home Screens
Shop, categories, and search: colors, font sizes, and product listing layout were determined by running multiple A/B tests. For the listing, it turned out that a grid arrangement slightly increased the conversions, thanks to its professionally shot pictures.
