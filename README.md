The final project

## ABOUT
Food delivery apps for one restaurant called NON SOLO PASTA

## Role
I started with competitive analysis by trying competitor apps and reading app reviews
Conducted user interviews with users who order food online or eat out.
Create low-mid hybrid screens in Figma
Create low-mid and high fidelity prototypes in Figma also

## Target and Challenge
NON SOLO PASTA had a very clear target, a target that needs an extremely easy and fast to use solution.

## Research
With the project idea defined, I searched online for food delivery apps which gave me a better understanding of the existing food delivery apps out there. For each app, I identified what key features they had and read reviews to identify pain points and what features people want.
